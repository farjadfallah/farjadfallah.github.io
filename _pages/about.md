I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, graduating in June 2026,  with a focused interest in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs) and their applications. My research experiences span developing machine learning systems for financial market surveillance, creating adaptive LLM-based agents for investor risk profiling, and exploring multimodal approaches to enhance intent recognition in human-robot interaction.

Through these diverse projects, I have cultivated a deep fascination for the inner workings of LLMs, both in enhancing their capabilities with multimodal data and in deploying them as agents to solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in how we can make these models more robust, interpretable, and effective in complex, ambiguous scenarios.

## Research Experience

### [MIIRA: Multimodal Imaginative Intent Recognition Agent](/research/miira)

This research introduces a novel framework that equips AI systems with an imagination module to resolve ambiguity in human-robot interaction. Inspired by human cognition, MIIRA generates internal multimodal simulations—narrative, visual, and auditory—from minimal textual instructions. By enriching sparse commands with imagined context, the system significantly improves a model's ability to infer intent in complex, underspecified domestic scenarios.

My contributions included designing and implementing the text enrichment pipeline, building the multimodal simulation components, and conducting comprehensive evaluations across different modality combinations. This work demonstrates my interest in enhancing LLM capabilities through multimodal integration and cognitive-inspired approaches.

### [Adaptive LLM Interviews for Investor Risk Profiling](/research/adaptive-llm-risk-profiling)

This project developed a novel two-agent LLM architecture for adaptive investor risk assessment, combining conversational AI with structured analytical reporting. The system conducts dynamic interviews that adjust question complexity based on user expertise, explores key risk dimensions through phased questioning, and generates comprehensive reports with numerical scores and narratives.

I was responsible for designing and implementing the interviewer agent, developing the Telegram bot interface, and handling system integration. This project reflects my interest in creating practical applications of LLMs that can adapt to user needs and provide personalized, nuanced assessments beyond what traditional questionnaires can offer.

## Featured Project

### [Detecting Insider Trading Patterns Using High-Frequency Market Data](/projects/insider-trading-detection)

This research project addresses persistent rumors of insider trading in the Iran stock market by developing a sophisticated machine learning system that detects anomalous trading patterns preceding significant news announcements. Our work demonstrates that systematic analysis of high-frequency market data can reveal patterns consistent with informed trading.

As a key member of the three-person team, my specific contributions included designing and implementing the feature engineering pipeline, developing novel evaluation metrics, creating statistical validation frameworks using Monte Carlo simulations, and implementing RNN/LSTM models for temporal pattern detection.

This project showcases my ability to work with complex, real-world datasets and develop machine learning solutions that have practical implications for financial market surveillance.

## [Teaching Experience](/teaching)

I have served as a Teaching Assistant for several courses at the University of Tehran, including Advanced Programming, Engineering Probability and Statistics, and Programming Languages and Compilers. In these roles, I have been responsible for designing assignments, conducting feedback sessions, and guiding students through complex technical concepts.

My teaching philosophy emphasizes not only helping students complete assignments but also ensuring they understand underlying principles and develop maintainable coding practices. I have particularly enjoyed the opportunity to contribute to curricular innovations, such as transitioning a course's programming component from Python to R to broaden students' methodological toolkit.

These experiences have honed my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively and have reinforced my commitment to fostering collaborative learning environments.
