In my second term as a Teaching Assistant for *Engineering Probability and Statistics*, I was selected as a supervisory TA under the instruction of [Dr. Bahrak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1IdcoLMAAAAJ&hl=en) (Computer Engineering cohort) and [Dr. Vahabie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gk4iZdUAAAAJ&hl=en) (Electrical Engineering cohort). My responsibilities included designing both a programming assignment and a theoretical homework set, balancing computational and conceptual learning outcomes. This semester, I contributed to a significant curricular innovation by helping transition the course’s programming component from Python to R, providing students exposure to a vector-based statistical language. This change was motivated by the recognition that while Python is covered extensively in other courses, R offers unique strengths for probabilistic modeling and statistical computing, thereby broadening students’ methodological toolkit.
