## Abstract

Investor risk profiling is critical for aligning financial advice with clients' risk tolerance, yet traditional methods face fundamental limitations: questionnaires lack depth and personalization, while human interviews are resource-intensive and unscalable. This research introduces a novel adaptive LLM-based system that conducts dynamic, conversational interviews to gather nuanced investor insights. Our two-agent architecture—featuring an adaptive interviewer and risk analyzer—adjusts question complexity based on user expertise, explores key risk dimensions through phased questioning, and generates structured reports with numerical scores, narratives, and visualizations. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate promising results in coherence, adaptability, and depth of assessment, suggesting strong potential for enhancing both user experience and profiling accuracy in financial advisory contexts.

## Interactive Demo

Experience the adaptive interviewer through our Telegram bot: [@agentic_risk_profiler_bot](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@agentic_risk_profiler_bot) or on the [website](http://46.249.101.59:8000/). The interface demonstrates the system's conversational capabilities and adaptive questioning strategies in real-time.


## Research Significance

Accurate risk profiling ensures investment recommendations match clients' financial situations and objectives while complying with regulatory frameworks (SEC, ESMA, MiFID II) that mandate thorough KYC processes. Current industry approaches remain limited by the efficiency-depth tradeoff: standardized questionnaires are scalable but impersonal, while interviews provide deeper insights but are resource-intensive. 

This work bridges this gap by leveraging recent advances in large language models to create adaptive, engaging interviews that scale like questionnaires but provide the depth of human interactions. Our approach has significant implications for financial advisory practice, potentially enhancing compliance, client trust, and portfolio customization while reducing administrative burdens.

## Methodology

### Modular Agent Architecture

We designed a novel two-agent system that separates conversational and analytical components:
- **Dynamic Interviewer Agent**: Conducts adaptive conversations using three mechanisms:
  1. Expertise-aware questioning (estimating proficiency from language complexity)
  2. Question selection (targeting informational gaps)
  3. Conversational flow maintenance (using full history for coherence)
  
- **Risk Analyzer Agent**: Processes dialogue into structured outputs across configurable dimensions (Risk Aversion, Capacity, Experience, Time Horizon, Volatility Management, Social Influencers), each with 5-6 metrics.

### Interview Process

The system employs a structured four-phase approach:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Gauges baseline knowledge through open-ended questions
2. **Broad Exploration**: Systematically covers all risk dimensions
3. **Focused Deep Dive**: Probes ambiguities and inconsistencies with scenario-based questions
4. **Gap Resolution**: Ensures completeness by consulting the analyzer for missing information

### Technical Implementation

Our implementation uses DeepSeek V3 but is model-agnostic, allowing flexibility for future deployments. The system incorporates specialized tools including:
- Scenario generator for personalized hypotheticals
- Proficiency estimator for adapting question complexity
- Termination assistant for determining data completeness
- Structured output generation via Pydantic for reliable reporting

## Preliminary Results

Our evaluation strategy includes both synthetic testing and preliminary human trials:

### Synthetic Evaluation
- Employed Grok 4 to generate artificial investor personas with predefined risk preferences
- System consistently produced reports with high internal consistency and alignment with assigned profiles
- Captured nuanced preferences across dimensions that traditional questionnaires typically miss

### Self-Administered Testing
- Project team and supervising professor engaged in multiple trials
- Demonstrated natural flow, adaptability, and conversation depth
- Superior coherence compared to traditional tools as noted by supervising professor

## Future Research Directions

This ongoing research project will expand in several directions:

1. **Controlled Human Evaluation**: Within-subjects experiment with 20 participants comparing our system against standardized questionnaires
2. **Integration Enhancement**: Incorporating historical trading data for deeper behavioral profiling
3. **Framework Expansion**: Adapting the system for trader self-assessment and portfolio manager evaluation
4. **Advanced Scenario Testing**: Developing Monte Carlo-style simulations for quantitative skill assessment
